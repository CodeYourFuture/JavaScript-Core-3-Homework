## 1. Install ESLint

Using ESLint can make debugging a lot easier. If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- 
Abstraction. Abstraction gives the programmer a great advantage of deducing solutions to new problems from previous solutions that the programmer is used to. Because it is very hard to just brute force your way and memorize different solutions to different problems you have to sharp your Abstraction skills.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- 
First understand the problem clearly to do that.
Try to explain it out loud as if you were talking to a someone else.

-->

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- 
Thinking about what you told the computer to do as opposed to what you want it to do. 
A good way to do that is to divide the problem into small manageable units of code and study each unit of code a lone.
