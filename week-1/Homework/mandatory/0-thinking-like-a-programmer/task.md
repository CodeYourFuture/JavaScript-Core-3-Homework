# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

Using ESLint can make debugging a lot easier. If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Write your answer here -->

Effective way of problem solving skill is the most important quality of a programmer.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Write your answer here -->

try to understand what exactly the problem is. try to draw a diagram or try to explain the problem to someone else or talk to rubber duck as if considering it is someone else to better understand what the problem is.

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Write your answer here -->

If youâ€™re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler.
-Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
-Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
