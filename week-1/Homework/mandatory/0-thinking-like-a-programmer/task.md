# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling. 

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

*  You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
*  You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Write your answer here --> I think the most important quality of a programmer is problem-solving.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Write your answer here --> First, you need to understand the challenge, that is, understand what is required of you in the challenge.

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Write your answer here --> If you get stuck, you can do a couple of things,

1. You can debug your code, i.e. go step by step through your solution to decipher where you went wrong.
2. You can research; it is important one researches the sub-challenges and not the entire challenge as the latter will add little or no value / improve one's understanding of the challenge.
3. You can take a step back and try look at the challenge from a different perspective. One way of doing this is starting afresh.

What you should not do when/if you get stuck is go on a trial and error expedition; it's best to have a structure / framework of what to do when you get stuck. And one should expect to get stuck as this is a part of the learning process.
