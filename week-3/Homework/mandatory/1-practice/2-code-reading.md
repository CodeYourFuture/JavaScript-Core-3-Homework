# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    {
3        let x = 2;
4        console.log(x);
5    }
6    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.
// line 4 prints 2 because the console is within the same block of x=2, whereas line 6 prints the global variable x= 1.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

// console.log(x) will print the value of the global variable x = 10, console.log(f1()) output is undefined because the function doesn't return a value but the last console outputs reference error because y is a local variable for the function f1 block only.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

//the code will work fine. the first console will print 9 because x is a global variable with value 9. the second console prints the object {x:10}
